**Samriddh Kheti** (meaning *Prosperous Farming*) is a multilingual, AI-driven web application designed to be a modern farmer's most trusted digital companion. By providing a suite of powerful, easy-to-use tools, we deliver personalized, data-driven insights to revolutionize agricultural practices in India.

## 1. The Problem

Indian farmers grapple with a complex set of challenges: unpredictable weather, inefficient water management, limited access to fair market pricing, and low awareness of beneficial government support schemes. This information gap leads to diminished crop yields, financial uncertainty, and wasted resources, ultimately impacting farmer livelihoods and the nation's food security.

## 2. Our Solution

Samriddh Kheti addresses these challenges by closing the information gap. Our platform empowers farmers to make informed, strategic decisions by analyzing farm-specific inputs (like location and soil type) alongside real-time weather and market data. We aim to make sophisticated agricultural insights accessible and understandable to every farmer, regardless of digital literacy or language.

## 3. Key Features

Our platform is built around a core set of features designed to address the key pain points of modern farming:

*   **üß† AI Crop Advisor**: Get personalized crop recommendations based on your farm's location, soil type, water availability, and your primary goal (e.g., maximizing profit, drought resistance).
*   **üíß Smart Irrigation Planner**: Receive an optimal irrigation schedule based on your crop type, location, and real-time weather data to conserve water and prevent crop stress.
*   **üî¨ Soil Quality Advisor**: Improve your soil's long-term health with actionable advice on crop rotation, organic fertilizers, and more, based on your cultivation history.
